WebGL in Nim
=========
Experimental wrapper to webgl for Nim (JS backend).  
Mostly taken from [mozilla webgl api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)

__NOTE: it is still incomplete and there are probably bugs__

A couple of examples are provided in `/examples` 
They are mostly translations of js code taken from mozilla tutorials and [webgl-lessons](https://github.com/tparisi/webgl-lessons), so
don't expect idiomatic nim code. I'll work on improving them ( PRs welcome! ).

Documentation
-------------
Some examples and autogenerated docs are avaliable in `/docs` and online at
[my site](http://stisa.space/webgl/)

To build the docs and examples, `clone` this repo and then run:
```
nimble builddocs
```
The docs are then available in `/docs`

Compiling to JS
---------------

```
nim js [-o:<outfile.js>] <filename> 
```

Note that the part between `[]` is optional, but it's useful as otherwise the `.js` file built by `nim`
would be in `nimcache`.

TODO
----

- move consts to enums?
- move function out of the `WebglRenderingContext` object, to have autodocs?
- Some utilites: others? ~~setting up a context~~, ~~reading errors~~, ~~emitting to console~~
- Have a module for `Webgl2`
- Show the code side-by-side with the examples
